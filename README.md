# JavaScript30 - Day 16

Welcome to Day 16 of JavaScript30! This is a 30-day vanilla JavaScript coding challenge created by Wes Bos. Each day, you will build something new using only vanilla JavaScript without any libraries or frameworks.

## Project: Mouse Move Shadow

In today's project, we will create a fun effect where the text shadow of an element follows the movement of the mouse. As you move the mouse over the element, the shadow will dynamically change based on the mouse position.

## Concepts Covered:

- Mouse event listeners (`mousemove`)
- Changing CSS styles dynamically
- Calculating positions based on mouse coordinates
- Transforming mouse coordinates into shadow effects

## Project Structure:

- `index.html`: HTML file that contains the structure and content of the project.
- `styles.css`: CSS file that contains the styling for the project.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file that contains the code for creating the mouse move shadow effect.

## Usage:

Move your mouse over the text to see the shadow effect in action. The shadow will follow the movement of the mouse.
